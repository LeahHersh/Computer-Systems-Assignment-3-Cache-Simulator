### Milestone 1 Implementation Details:

Only csim and a main file is part of the executable.




### Milestone 2 Implementation Details:

The simulator's cycle count isn't always accurate, and I think write-throughs might not be handled correctly.




### Milestone 3 Implementation Details:

1. When there is a cache miss, invalid/empty slots are identified by their load and access times being the same as their timestamps

2. This submission used late time going into March 30th, when ugrad machines were down, so the experiment data mentioned in the
cache report come from results posted on Courselore that were not produced by this simulator. If it would be better to use this simulator's
data I would be happy to update it when the ugrad machines are back up later. 




### Report on Best Cache Configuration:

Based on simulation results,
